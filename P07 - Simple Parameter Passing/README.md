###Project 7 - Simple Parameter Passing

---
Write a C program that will perform the following:
In main(), print your name and your UIN to the standard output. (The standard output is your terminal window.

In main(), prompt the user for two integer values and read them in. The prompt is to use the printf() function and the read is to use the scanf() function. Then, print out both variables after they were read in in a descriptive manner

Write a function called max(), that will take in two integer parameters and return the larger of the two integers. Call this function from main() using the values read in during part 2. Print out the value returned by the function using printf(). 

Write a function called swap() that will take two parameters and exchange the values so that the values are exchanged in the calling code. Call this function from main() using the values read in during part 2. Print out the values in the variables both before and after the call to swap().

In main(), create an integer array to hold 10 integer values. Prompt the user for 10 integer values and read in these integer values using a loop and store them in the array. Use printf() and scanf() for the prompting and reading of the values.

Write a function called sum() that will take an array as a parameter (it may have other parameters) and return sum of all values in the array. Call this function from main() using the values read in and stored in the array during part 5. Print out the value returned by the function using printf().

Write a function called adjust() that will take an array as a parameter (it may have other parameters) and increment the values in the array by random amounts (use the rand() function to determine that adjustment amount). Call this function from main() using the values read in and stored in the array during part 5. Print ouf the values in the array both before and after the call to adjust(). 

All prompts and outputs must be descriptive! The C library functions of scanf() and printf() must be used for all input and output for this program.
