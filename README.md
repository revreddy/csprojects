### CSPROJECTS

---
Projects in this repository were created as part of various individual course work using the guidelines and constraints outlined for that particular project. The assignments often attempt to force programming with rudimentary syntax with limited library access to emphasize learning aspects of those concepts and abstractions.

---
Below is a table that indicates the programming languages used for each project:

Language | Project Numbers
:---------|:----------------
|**C**    |1, 2\*, 3\*, 4\*, 5\*, 6\*, 7, 8, 9, 10
|**C#**   |18, 20, 21
|**Java** |14, 16, 19
|**C++**  |11, 12, 13
|**F#**   |15, 17

*These projects are written in traditional C syntax while taking advantage of some the improved basic libraries of C++, like iostream and iomanip.
